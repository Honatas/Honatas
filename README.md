Well, ðŸ‘‹ hi there! My name is **Jonatas** and I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer from Brazil. Welcome to my Github page!  

I'll present here some software I've come up with, and what has motivated me to code them. These are organized by field, so feel free to browse which section most interest you.

## Front end

**Multi Select Webcomponent** ([https://github.com/Honatas/multi-select-webcomponent](https://github.com/Honatas/multi-select-webcomponent)) is a [Webcomponent](https://www.webcomponents.org) that allows you to make multiple selections while having almost the same complexity as adding a \<select\> tag to your html.  

**A WebComponent journey** ([https://dev.to/honatas/a-webcomponent-journey-1kma](https://dev.to/honatas/a-webcomponent-journey-1kma)) is an article where I go through all the development and thought process of Multi Select Webcomponent.  

**Bootstrap 4 Autocomplete** ([https://github.com/Honatas/bootstrap-4-autocomplete](https://github.com/Honatas/bootstrap-4-autocomplete)) is a bit older, but if you are still using Bootstrap 4 and JQuery, maybe this autocomplete plugin can fit your needs.  

**Frameworkless JAMStack** ([https://github.com/Honatas/frameworkless-jamstack](https://github.com/Honatas/frameworkless-jamstack)) is a PoC (Proof of Concept) that showcases how one can get a modern web development enviroment without resorting to feature-bloated frameworks.

**Properly precompile Handlebars templates and partials with Gulp** ([https://dev.to/honatas/properly-precompile-handlebars-templates-and-partials-with-gulp-4g91](https://dev.to/honatas/properly-precompile-handlebars-templates-and-partials-with-gulp-4g91)) is an article demonstrating how to precompile Handlebars templates in a most effective way.  


## Back end

**Field Validator** ([https://github.com/Honatas/field-validator](https://github.com/Honatas/field-validator)) is a Java validation tool that leverages Java's lambda functions allowing you to create your set of validators and execute them over arbitrary data.  

**A different approach to User Sessions in Microservices using Redis** ([https://dev.to/honatas/a-different-approach-to-user-sessions-in-microservices-5bpi](https://dev.to/honatas/a-different-approach-to-user-sessions-in-microservices-5bpi)) is an article presenting an alternative to using JWTs for user session control in a microservices environment.  

**Is Hibernate Really Worth It?** ([https://dev.to/honatas/is-hibernate-really-worth-it-1cmi](https://dev.to/honatas/is-hibernate-really-worth-it-1cmi)) is an article where I discuss the downsides of using ORMs and present an alternative to it.  


## Devops

**Ansible Role - OpenJDK** ([https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-openjdk-ppa](https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-openjdk-ppa)) is an Ansible role that installs any version of OpenJDK from Matthias Klose's openjdk-r PPA repository.  

**Ansible Role - PostgreSQL** ([https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-postgresql-dev](https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-postgresql-dev)) is an Ansible role that installs PostgreSQL with remote access enabled, suitable for development environments.  

**Ansible Role - Tomcat** ([https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-tomcat-dev](https://github.com/Honatas/ansible-role-tomcat-dev)) is an Ansible role that installs Apache Tomcat with the Manager GUI enabled, suitable for development environments.
